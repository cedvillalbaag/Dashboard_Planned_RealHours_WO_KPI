# Dashboard Planned-Real Hours Work Orders - KPI

Efficient time and resource management is the cornerstone of a high-performance maintenance department. Implementing a dashboard in Power BI to analyze KPIs of planned versus actual work order hours is not simply a reporting enhancement; it is an indispensable tool for process optimization, identification of inefficiencies and continuous improvement that will directly impact your bottom line.

### The Current Challenge
Currently, if you are not measuring and analyzing the variance between planned and actual execution hours, you are operating with limited visibility into one of the most significant costs in maintenance: labor. This leads to:

#### Inaccurate Estimates: 
- Time schedules are guesses, not actual data to improve future accuracy.

#### Hidden Inefficiencies: 
- Bottlenecks, lack of training, problems with tools or spare parts that prolong tasks are not easily identified.

#### Waste of Resources:
- More or less time is allocated than necessary, resulting in idle or overloaded technicians and unjustified overtime.

#### Difficulty in Justifying Investments:
- Without solid data, it is difficult to support the need for additional staff, training or new tools.

#### Suboptimal Scheduling:
- Work allocation is based on historical estimates that may not reflect the reality of performance.


### The Value of the Dashboard: Savings and Cost Reduction

Implementing this dashboard in Power BI to analyze the KPIs of planned vs. actual hours will generate tangible savings and significant cost reduction in your maintenance operation:

#### 1. Optimizing Labor Productivity:
- Impact: By comparing planned vs. actual hours, it is possible to identify which tasks or equipment consistently require more or less time than expected. This allows you to adjust schedules, train personnel in weak areas and optimize resource allocation.
- Potential Savings: An estimated 10% to 20% improvement in labor efficiency. If your maintenance department spends, for example, $500,000 per year on salaries, this could mean a savings of $50,000 to $100,000 per year in better utilization of staff time alone.

#### 2. Reducing Overtime and Personnel Costs:
- Impact: Negative variances (actual hours >> planned hours) are often the primary driver of unbudgeted overtime. By identifying and addressing the root causes of these variances, you can proactively manage the workload and minimize the need to pay overtime.
- Potential Savings: You could see a 5% to 15% decrease in overtime costs by improving the accuracy of estimates and efficiency in execution.

#### 3. Improved Planning and Scheduling Accuracy:
- Impact: With real data, future planning will be much more accurate. This leads to more realistic scheduling, avoiding production delays or maintenance bottlenecks.
- Potential Savings: Although difficult to quantify with a direct percentage in maintenance, better scheduling can translate into a 5% to 10% reduction in equipment downtime due to inefficient maintenance management, which directly impacts production capacity and revenue.
  
#### 4. Identification of Training and Process Improvement Opportunities:
- Impact: The dashboard will reveal where performance is not meeting expectations (e.g., specific technicians, types of equipment, or procedures). This facilitates the identification of training needs or the revision of standard operating procedures (SOPs).
- Potential Savings: By improving staff skills and processes, rework, errors and time consumed are reduced, which indirectly generates ongoing savings and improves the quality of maintenance service.

### Other Value Added Insights
Beyond direct cost savings and cost reduction, this dashboard will bring significant value in other dimensions:

#### Technician Productivity Management:
- Allowing you to monitor individual and team performance, recognizing high performers and supporting those who need improvement. This is not micro-management, but data-driven management for staff development.

#### Maintenance Budget Optimization:
- By better understanding the actual usage of hours, a more realistic and accurate budget for labor can be built, justifying staffing needs and avoiding budget variances.

#### Reliability Engineering Support:
- Deviations can point to underlying problems with equipment reliability (e.g., repetitive failures requiring more time than planned), or design or installation problems. This provides crucial data for reliability improvement initiatives.

#### Work Standards Validation:
- The dashboard serves as a powerful tool to validate the effectiveness of work standards and preventive and predictive maintenance procedures. If the planned time is consistently exceeded, it is a signal to review and optimize the SOP.

#### Fostering a Culture of Continuous Improvement:
- By making these KPIs visible, the maintenance team is empowered to understand their performance, identify their own challenges and propose solutions, fostering a proactive and continuous improvement mindset.
  
#### Basis for Strategic Asset Decisions: 
- Information on maintenance efficiency by asset can influence long-term capital decisions, such as the need to replace problematic equipment or invest in technology that reduces downtime.
